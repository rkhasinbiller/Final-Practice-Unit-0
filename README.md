1. App Description:
This app is designed for traveling CrossFit athletes who want to maintain their training routine while on the go. The app will:

Allow users to search for CrossFit-affiliated and independent gyms worldwide.

Display gym details, drop-in pricing, schedules, and user reviews.

Integrate with location services to suggest nearby gyms.

Offer a filtering system (e.g., "Has Open Gym," "Offers Drop-Ins," "Has Showers").

Provide a community rating system to help users find the best locations.

2. Applying Course Skills to the App:
Organization and Time Management – The project will be structured into components (e.g., location search, gym details, reviews). A Trello board or GitHub Issues will track tasks and ensure organized development.

Values, Data Types, and Operations – Gym data will be stored using objects, and numerical operations will be used for sorting and filtering (e.g., ranking gyms by rating).

The Growth Mindset – Debugging and iterating will be key. If a feature doesn’t work as expected, I will take a step back, review errors, and implement incremental improvements.

Stringing Characters Together – The app will format gym descriptions dynamically using string concatenation or template literals (e.g., "Welcome to " + gym.name + " located at " + gym.address).

Control Structures and Logic – An if-else structure will check whether a gym has certain amenities (e.g., "if (gym.hasShowers) { displayAmenityIcon() }").

Working with Loops – A loop will iterate through an array of gyms to display a list of available locations.

Building Arrays – Gym information will be stored as an array of objects, allowing efficient data manipulation and search functionality.

Using Arrays – Methods like .filter(), .map(), and .sort() will be used to refine search results and enhance user experience.
